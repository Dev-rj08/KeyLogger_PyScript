# KeyLogger_PyScript
A keylogger is a software or hardware tool that secretly records the keystrokes made on a keyboard. It can be used for both legitimate purposes, like security research and parental control, as well as malicious activities, such as unauthorized surveillance and cybercrime. Using keyloggers for malicious intent is illegal and unethical.
